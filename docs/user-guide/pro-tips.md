# Team-Mail productivity tips

This page makes a list of all features that TeamMail advanced users would love.

## Drag and drop mails

You can use this feature to move email to another folder 

1. On the email listing view of a folder, find the email you want to move and long-press (tap and hold) it. After a moment, the email will be selected.

2. While still holding the email, drag it to the desired folder or label. You can scroll through your folders list by dragging the email to the edge of the screen.

3. Once you have dragged the email to the desired location, release your finger to drop the email. It will be moved to the new folder accordingly.

You can also select multiple emails by tapping on the sender's profile picture or icon and then dragging them together to the desired location.

If you accidentally drag and drop an email, you can quickly undo the action by shaking your device. A pop-up will appear, allowing you to undo the move.

## Drag and drop recipients

- This feature will help you to move recipents easily between fields "To", "Cc", "Bcc" when you compose an email

1. Either start composing a new email or open an existing email draft where you want to modify the recipients.
2. Look for the area where you add recipients to your email. Typically, this is the "To," "Cc," or "Bcc" field
3. Holding down the recipient's email, drag it to the desired recipient field. For example, if you initially placed the recipient in the "To" field but want to move them to the "Cc" field, drag the recipient to the "Cc" field.
4. Once you have dragged the recipient to the correct field, release your finger (on a touchscreen device) or release the mouse button (on a computer). The recipient should now be moved to the new location.
